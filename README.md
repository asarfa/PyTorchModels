# PyTorch Abstraction Layer

PyTorch Abstraction Layer is an open-source project that provides a high-level API for PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The goal of this project is to simplify and abstract the low-level PyTorch API and make it easier for users to quickly build and train deep learning models.

## Key Features

- A simple and intuitive generic classes for building complex deep learning models
- Convenient utility classes for common deep learning tasks such as data loading, data preprocessing, and model training
- Abstraction layer for PyTorch modules and optimizers to make it easier to work with complex models

## Installation

You can use this classes by cloning this repo on your computer and importing the classes you want
